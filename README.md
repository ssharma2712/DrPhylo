# DrPhylo analysis for detecting fragile clades in an inferred phylogeny from phylogenomic datasets #

DrPhylo investigates major species relationships in phylogenies inferred from phylogenomic datasets. This approach applies evolutionary sparse learning (ESL) to build a genetic model for a clade of interest for a given set of sequence alignments from genes or genomic loci (see citation #2). DrPhylo outputs:
<br />


```
Gene species concordance (GSC)              : A numeric value that identifies gene-species combinations (sequence) harboring concordant ( GSC > 0) or conflicting (GSC < 0) phylogenetic signals. 

Sequence Classification Probability (SCP)   : Classification probability for a species for being a member of the clade of interest.  

Clade Proabaility (CP)                      : Probability (0-1) for the clade of interest. A low value for CP indicates the plausibility of being fragile.  

Model grid                                  : This is a grid representation of the clade model. The rows of this grid represent species with SCP and columns for genes. 
                                              Green       (GSC > 0 )
                                              Red         (GSC < 0 )
                                              White       (GSC = 0 )
                                              Cross mark  (Missing data)

## DrPhylo Analysis ## 

DrPhylo is integrated into MyESL, which can be implemented using the ```--DrPhylo``` flag in MyESL. Therefore, installing MyESL will allow users to implement DrPhylo. MyESL can be installed in the Python environment using the source codes and the instructions below. A user can also use MyESL as a standalone executable software, which does not require installation.    

## MyESL.exe for DrPhylo analysis ##

To run DrPhylo integrated into MyESL, download MyESL using: 

```
git clone -b DrPhylo https://github.com/kumarlabgit/MyESL DrPhylo
cd MyESL

```

## Basic input for DrPhylo analysis using default options ##
DrPhylo analysis in MyESL requires the list of paths for all groups (sequence alignments of genes or genetic loci in fasta format) as a text file and a phylogenetic hypothesis. The phylogenetic hypothesis tested by DrPhylo can be provided using a phylogenetic tree in newick format or a text file containing the hypothesis. 

## Implementation ##

After downloading, a user can perform DrPhylo analysis using the required inputs and other necessary optional arguments.

<br />

```
MyESL.exe --DrPhylo alignment_list.txt  --tree phylogenetic_tree.nwk

OR

MyESL.exe --DrPhylo alignment_list.txt  --classes phylogenetic_hypothesis.txt
```
<br />


#### Required arguments:

<br />

```

alignment_list.txt                       : A text file contains a list of paths for all sequence alignments. For example,
                                           angiosperm_alns/7276_C12.fasta
                                           angiosperm_alns/5111_C12.fasta
                                           angiosperm_alns/5507_C12.fasta

--tree <phylogenetic_tree.nwk>           : A phylogenetic tree in newick format with a node ID to construct a hypothesis for the clade of interest.
                                           The hypothesis can also be specified with a separate file using the --classes parameter.
                                           It is highly recommended that the number of species in the clade be equal to or greater than those outside of the clade.
                                           It is also recommended to use the smart sampling option (â€”-balancing) when the number of species inside the clade is greater than the number outside the clade.
OR

--classes <phylogenetic_hypothesis.txt> : Requires a text file containing a user-defined hypothesis. It has two columns, which are tab-separated. The first column contains species names, and the second column contains the response 
                                          value for the species (+1/-1). A member species in the clade receives +1 and -1 otherwise. This hypothesis is unconstrained by the tree structure. It is highly recommended that the number of 
                                          species within the clade of interest (+1) is equal to the number of species outside the clade. The hypothesis can also be specified using a separate text file provided using the --response 
                                          parameter.  

```
<br />	


DrPhylo builds multiple ESL models by performing a ```grid search``` over the discrete sparsity parameters (group and site) space. DrPhylo achieves computational efficiency by early terminating the grid-search process and selecting only multi-gene models. 

DrPhylo outputs a model grid (```M-grid```) and a text file in a matrix format containing the model. A ```M-grid``` is a two-dimensional graphical presentation of the ESL model containing species names with classification probability (rows) and groups sorted by influence (columns).  

#### Optional argumnets:

<br />

```
--clade_list <string1, string2,...>  : Users can test multiple phylogenetic hypotheses when the input phylogenetic tree contains multiple clade IDs. This option must be used with "--tree" option.
--gen_clade_id <int, int>            : Users can generate multiple hypotheses when the input phylogeny contains no clade ID. The size of the clade is determined by the input integers defining the upper and lower limits
                                       of clade size, respectively.   
--lamda1_grid <min, max, step>       : This option allows users to set the range for the site sparsity parameter. The site sparsity grid is defined by a string of float numbers min, max, step_size which range from 0 to 1.
                                       For example, --lamda1_range 0.1, 0.9, 0.1. This option must be used with --lamda2_range.  

--lamda2_grid <min, max, step>       : This option allows users to set the range for the group sparsity parameter. The group sparsity grid is defined by a string of float numbers min, max, step_size which range from 0 to 1.
                                       For example, --lamda2_range 0.1, 0.9, 0.1. This option must be used with --lamda1_range. 

--min_groups <int>                   : This option allows users to set the minimum number of genes included in the multi-gene ESL models and helps early stopping in the grid search over the sparsity parameter space.
                                       It takes a value greater than zero (0) and builds models containing more or equal numbers of groups in the model.

--class_bal <string>                : DrPhylo also performs class balancing, a common practice in supervised machine learning. Class balancing helps balance the number of species inside and outside the focal clade of interest.
                                      Class balancing in DrPhylo is performed by phylogenetic aware sampling <phylo> when the phylogenetic hypothesis is provided by the "--tree" option. DrPhylo also makes a balance between classes 
                                      by using inverse weights using the option <weight>. 
--output <string>                   : The name of the output directory where all results from DrPhylo analysis will be stored. The program creates this directory automatically. 
```
<br />	

## DrPhylo implementation using example dataset ##

After finishing the setup, change the directory to `DrPhylo-master`. To create a text file containing the list of paths for all gene sequence alignments: 
```
cd sample_files
ls angiosperm_alns/*.fasta > angiosperm_100_sample_alns.txt
cd ..
```
<br />
<br />

DrPhylo analysis for building clade models for two labeled clades, producing a result set for each of two hypotheses generated from the input tree:
<br />
<br />

```
MyESL.exe --DrPhylo sample_files/angiosperm_100_sample_alns.txt --tree sample_files/ESL_test.nwk --output sample_tree_output

```
<br />

DrPhylo analysis using a user-defined hypothesis, producing a single clade model for the given hypothesis:
<br />

```
MyESL.exe --DrPhylo sample_files/angiosperm_100_sample_alns.txt --output sample_tree_output --classes sample_files/test_pred.txt

```
<br />

DrPhylo analysis for building an ensemble clade model for a user-defined hypothesis using the grid search option. The site and gene sparsity score range from 0.05 to 0.1 and a step size of 0.05:
<br />

```
MyESL.exe --DrPhylo sample_files/angiosperm_100_sample_alns.txt --classes sample_files/test_pred.txt --lambda1_range 0.05,0.1,0.05 --lambda2_range 0.05,0.1,0.05 --output sample_grid2x2_output 

```
<br />


### Model grid from DrPhylo

DrPhylo also generates outputs an ensemble clade model when the grid search option is used:

```

{internal_node_label}_GSC_median.txt : Dataframe contaiang GSC, SCP and CP.

{internal_node_label}_GSC_median.png : Grid representation of the ensemble clade model using *_GSC_median.txt. This visualization will also contain SCP for all species in the clade of interest.
                                       The taxa with the lowest SCP will be at the top of the grid, and the lowest SCP for the clade is defined as the CP for the clade of interest. 

```
Note: The `{inter_node_label}` will be replaced by the text file name when the `--classes` option is used for providing a user-defined phylogenetic hypothesis.
